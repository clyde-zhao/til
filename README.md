A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a variety of things: technologies (mostly), my hobbies, tips...

There are things that don't really warrant a full article. TILs are short Markdown notes, and they might be incomplete (mostly) :bow: :bow:

Here is til's guideline: Assume that you want to find about `<keyword>` (replace `<keyword>` with your actual one), do the follow steps:

- Come to this page.
- Hit <kbd>S</kbd> to search over this repository, enter your `<keyword>`.
- If the above steps return nothing useful, hit <kbd>T</kbd> to perform a fuzzy search files through repository. Continue type `<keyword>`.
- Maybe I don't write (and know) about `<keyword>`, continue your search somewhere else. Good luck :bow:
- **AI is amazing, you can find [even better TIL with Deepwiki](https://deepwiki.com/ntk148v/til/)**.
